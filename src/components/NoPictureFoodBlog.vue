                The story about my last food mission was supposed to go here.  The only food that got weird here was green beans.

                I never gave garbanzo beans much thought but I'm finding out they are a great alternative to something such as barbeque baked beans and aren't sweet.
                Not to mention they don't give you gas.  I'm also using this as a carbohydrate alternative compared to bread or rice.  I love bread but get sick of rice quickly.

                ingredients
                1 can precooked garbanzo beans (15oz) - your standard can of beans at the store
                frozen green beans (1/4 cup)
                cold, precooked fajita marinated chicken (special/link) (~18oz)


                -reheat the chicken on a low heat for 20 minutes
                -blanch the frozen green beans
                -combine blanched and strained once frozen green beans with room temperature canned contents of garbanzo beans
                -reheat the now bean mixture on low heat for 10-15 minutes adding flavors.

                I added pepper, paprika, and salt to my beans to try.  Then a few dabs of El Yucateco Habanero Hot Sauce.
                This is my go to hot sauce and found it to fit nicely surprisingly.  Always you could just take the chicken and hot sauce and go make actual fajitas.

                Pineapple juice to drink was great here too.  Or like an orange juice.     

                As a healthy alternative meal for any reason, this one was surprisingly ok.
