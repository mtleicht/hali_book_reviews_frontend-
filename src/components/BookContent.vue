    The Review: 

    If you are considering going to college or you are a parent considering for your kid, this is a book I would say is a great candidate for your research.
    If you like to read books or an American or going to college doesn't apply to you at all, theres still some interesting information in this book.

    I received this book as a gift and didn't think I was the appropriate audience for it.
    I went to a smaller public college about 15 years ago (~2005) in Illinois and missed out on a lot of the controversy this book describes.  
    My senior seminar class was a blow over but that was about it.

    What is one of the most interesting things about this book is the 30 pages of references at the end.  
    There is over 250 sources that point to his statistics and information that back up his opinions.
    And I imagine his 10 years of experience talking to thousands of students on campus, he was able to cherry pick some of the best stories he heard first hand, included accesory research and wrote about it.
    I'm not going to fact check him, but I get the impression he had a lot of experience which motivated his effort in writing this book.
    I try to have good faith in people before forming an opinion so I'm giving the author positive ideas up front.

    The book was a pretty normal reading level for me so I didn't have to stop and look up words in the dictionary.  But I still did from time to time as that is something of interest to me.
    He has an opinion on almost every viewpoint and argument for why the general American consensus says you should go to college.


    He speaks to how college have changed in many ways, such as campus culture, its administration, and faculty opinions.    

    To highlight some of the topics he discusses included "The Freshman 15", general experience of college being worth it, alcohol, friends, networking, maturity.
    He demonstrates how the cost is no longer worth it for majority of degrees and why you are likely to be debt striken for decades.  Specifically due to the exorbitant cost and how
     you cannot declare bankruptcy on student loans.

    How Covid made the value of your college purchase even less valueable.

    He talks about prestigious colleges like Princeton, Yale, Harvard, and more.

    Inefficienciess of college management and administration.  How the college operations have become bloasted and their correlation to the price of tuition.

    Waste and corruption with examples of classes that sports players favored since they were almost guranteed a passing and basically a forged grade with minimal educational effort.

    How people were less prepared for their career when looking at attributes that employers were looking for.  Such as critical thinking, writing ability, and complex reasoning.
    I remember that my writing ability never noticiably improved to my self until I had been in the work force for a couple years after college.  I hope you don't judge my write up too much.
    This article is more geared as a brief to my <a href="">video content</a> instead of a news media publication.

    He also gives examples of the types of academics who teach in our schools and finds their contradictions and hypocracies.

    He talks about negative demonstrations and petitions against TPUSA's appearance on campus.  
    
    He describes student experiences when free speech was defended or allowed.  Some of those larger topics included capitalism, Christianity, conservatism, attire, race, ethnicity, and non-aggressive behavior.

    He gives examples of violent felonies being committed by the supporters of Kirk's opposing view and how the perpetrators were not being disciplined.  
    These violent acts included assault, arson, and destruction of property.

    Where the book takes a bit of a turn is the idea of multiple univerisites being infiltrated by foreign powers through influence with large donations, Chinese Confucius Institutions and their
    risk as a trojan horse.  The countries included Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Russia, China, Palestine, Iran, UAE, Kuwait, Iraq, and Turkey.

    Anti Semetism demonstrated by Palestinian college charters.  
    I was very surprised to hear about this, since I hear a decent amount of verbal abuse against parties expressing anti semetic views (some call it Hate speech) in the media.

    Faculty terminating or lobbying for termination of colleagues because of their beliefs and opinions.

    The origins of Critical Race Theory and its philosophy.  This was very intersting to read about since it's a relatively new idea for me and perhaps others.
    I didn't know anything about its origins or have much knowledge on its philosophy.  Honestly, it gives more credence to the author's opinion.

    He also talks about Antifa and their presence on campus.  I mean, if you're looking to join, this book indirectly points you where to start looking if you're interested.

    For the people that aren't looking to pursue higher education with university, a lot of alternative ideas in the pursuit of success are provided and examples of successful notable people
    without degrees.  And the stigma of not having a degree and how culture and business is slowly changing it's perspective.
    

    One of my favorite sections was chapter 5 and the phony peer review academic papers that made me laugh out loud.

    Charlie Kirk is the founder of <a href="https://www.tpusa.com/" target="_blank">Turning Point USA</a>.
    I think he is a conservative with strong opinions.

    As always, this review and this channel is about critical thinking and free thought to form your own opinion.  Let me know your thoughts and comments on <a href="">Youtube</a>.
